<!-- Information -->
<br/><h2 align="center">üê≥ Blueprint in Docker</h2>

**Uploading extensions**\
Extensions must be placed/dragged into the `extensions` folder.

**Interacting with Blueprint**\
By default, you can only interact with blueprint by going through the Docker command line, i.e.
```bash
docker compose exec panel blueprint (arguments)
```

We recommend setting an alias so you can interact with blueprint the same way you would in the non-Docker version (If you have your compose file in a different place, adjust accordingly:
```bash
# Set alias for current session
alias blueprint="docker compose -f /srv/pterodactyl/docker-compose.yml exec panel blueprint"
# Append to the end of your .bashrc file to make it persistent
echo 'alias blueprint="docker compose -f /srv/pterodactyl/docker-compose.yml exec panel blueprint"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

**Example of installing an extension**\
Here's a quick example showcasing how you would go about installing extensions on the Docker version of Blueprint. Note that your experience can differ for every extension.
  1. [Find an extension](https://blueprint.zip/browse) you would like to install and look for a file with the `.blueprint` file extension.
  2. Drag/upload the `example.blueprint` file over/onto to your extensions folder, i.e. by default `/srv/pterodactyl/extensions`.
  3. Install the extension through the Blueprint command line tool:
     ```bash
     docker compose exec panel blueprint -install example
     ```
     Alternatively, if you have applied the alias we suggested above:
     ```bash
     blueprint -install example
